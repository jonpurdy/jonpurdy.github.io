<p>I want to use my brain for working on big picture and detailed work, not for planning on what to work on. The world operates on cycles: breathing every 3-10 seconds, work/play/sleep every 24 hours, quarterly/annual financials every 3 or 12 months.</p>
<p><em>My strategy: use what's essentially a recurring to-do list.</em></p>
<h3>For each cycle:</h3>
<ul>
<li>List the task(s) that need to get done</li>
</ul>
<h3>For each task:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Details about how to complete the task, including links to previous task output, where to gather details, etc.</li>
<li>A checklist of subtasks or steps for completion</li>
<li>Prerequisite tasks (ie. what tasks need to be done to feed input into the current task)</li>
<li>The last date the task was done</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/20240220-how-i-work-cyclically/inputs.png" alt="inputs" width="100%" /></p>
<p>As an Infrastructure TPM at <a href="https://chainsafe.io">ChainSafe</a>, this is what my list generally looks like:</p>
<h3>Daily</h3>
<ul>
<li>Check and follow up on email</li>
<li>Check and follow up on Slack</li>
<li>Check incidents channel to see if anything bad happened</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weekly</h3>
<ul>
<li>One-line status update on each program initiative on "initiatives tracker", and setting green/yellow/red status</li>
<li>Looking for changes to infrastructure</li>
<li>People allocations: verify team members worked on what they committed do, update this for the next week</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bi-weekly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update program sponsors using inputs from initiative tracker, 2-3 bullet points on highlights/things to watch out for (and send the link to the full tracker)</li>
<li>Verify transactions for all Infrastructure spending</li>
<li>Do program retrospective and planning session</li>
<li>Evaluate new ideas/opportunities using Evaluation Framework</li>
</ul>
<h3>Monthly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pull stats (monthly revenue and expenses) via Python script </li>
<li>Write Infrastructure Newsletter (targeting wide company audience) using inputs from Python script and biweekly updates</li>
<li>Update exec audience with specific requested stats</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quarterly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quarterly OKRs: review current, set new ones</li>
</ul>
<h3>Yearly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Annual program objectives: review current, set new ones</li>
</ul>
<p>At the start of a new period (weekly, for example), I know that I have 3 things to do that are due at the end of that week. So as long as I get them done at some point that week, I'm doing well and can relax. If it's Friday and I still need to accomplish tasks on my weekly list, I know I need to crunch to get them done (or at least catch up on them the next week).</p>
<p>Sometimes, the end of periods collides (ie. the end of the month could also be the end of the week). This is generally not a problem since I am not working to 100% capacity<a href="#fn1">※</a>, so I can easily spread my work out over the course of each time period.</p>
<p><fn id=fn1><i>※ - It's important to have some slack in one's schedule. From "This is Lean":<br />
‣ <em>the closer we get to one hundred percent utilization, the longer the throughput time.</em><br />
‣ <em>The paradox is that a greater focus on utilizing resources efficiently tends to increase the amount of work there is to do.</em></fn></p>
