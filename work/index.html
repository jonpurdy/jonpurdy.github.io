<h2>TPM Infrastructure @ ChainSafe (2023-2025)</h2>
<p><a name="chainsafe1"></a></p>
<h3>Program launch</h3>
<ul>
<li>Launched official Infrastructure program, based around revenue generation via staking and providing internal and community infrastructure/DevOps services.</li>
<li>CS Infra went from ~US$500MM ‚Üí ~US$1B AUM within the first year (üôè ETH/USD price) and the program grew from 2 to 6 FTEs.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="chainsafe2"></a></p>
<h3>Risk management</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decentralization initiatives related to two problems.<br>
‚ë† single provider outage (causing financial + reputational damage)<br>
‚ë° Geth (execution layer client) supermajority bug (slashing risk)  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post-mitigation results: multi-provider multi-location validators connected to multiple EL client types (Nethermind/Besu/Geth), with the ability to quickly migrate validators, and enough capacity to absorb additional load in case of outages.  </p>
</li>
<li>Related initiatives decreased incident time-to-resolve (TTR) by 31%, reduced incidents requiring intervention by 10%.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="chainsafe3"></a></p>
<h3>Talent development</h3>
<ul>
<li>Empowered team members to grow while making as much of my own role redundant as possible (reducing bus factor).</li>
<li>I ensured that initiatives had a DRI/Driver: a single person who clearly owns and is accountable for it, with support from myself and anyone else who can help them achieve the initiative.</li>
<li>Resulted in the promotion of two team members (from IC ‚Üí EM, and IC ‚Üí Lead).</li>
<li>Resulted in numerous successful IC-led initiatives (such as Ethereum Ephemery testnet nodes, L2 Rollup IaC), tied to company goals (via program objectives) which directly increased revenue and/or improved ChainSafe‚Äôs reputation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Program Manager @ TextNow (2020-2023)</h2>
<p><a name="textnow1"></a></p>
<h3>SwiftUI iOS app rewrite</h3>
<ul>
<li>The usual TPM workload, but most interesting part was setting expectations based on previous data points and updated forecasts (probabilistic: Monte Carlo).</li>
<li>Direct result: forecasts became more accurate resulting in a more realistic timeline (delaying by 1 year backed by the forecasted data). In Beta, the result of the new app was 50-75%+ less lines of code, easier and faster for developers to add features, and reduced crashes and bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/work/textnow-montecarlo.png" width=100%/>  </p>
<p><a name="textnow2"></a></p>
<h3>Jira Analysis Tool</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wrote a custom Python-based tool to perform analyses via Jira API. It can calculate and visualize time in progress, estimation accuracy analysis (days per point), generate network graphs of tickets, output per-developer throughput charts, etc.</li>
<li>Result has been greater understanding of the relationships between tickets in Jira and using per-developer workload and throughput in forecasting for greater accuracy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blockchain Projects</h2>
<p>At BlockX Labs, I helped build more than a few different blockchain projects.  These are the public-facing ones that I can share.</p>
<p>For all of these projects, I:<br>
- <strong>translated</strong> client requirements and feature requests to user stories <br>
- <strong>facilitated</strong> product roadmap creation, release planning, and sprint planning, as well as inter-sprint ceremonies: daily scrums, demos, sprint review, and retrospectives<br>
- <strong>improved products</strong> by gathering and implementing feedback from development and user communities<br>
- <strong>built</strong> product websites, FAQ, and documentation<br>
- <strong>designed and built</strong> interactive product wireframes (for Enzyme and Universal Wallet) so that development teams would get a clear picture of how products should work.</p>
<p>As a de-facto Release Manager on these wallets and without budget for QA, I took it on myself. But I hate doing manual repeated work, so I wrote macros in <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/">Keyboard Maestro</a> to fully automate end-to-end testing.</p>
<p><img src="/images/work/keyboardmaestro.png" width=100%/></p>
<p><a name="aiwa"></a></p>
<h3>AIWA (2018)</h3>
<p>The first wallet we built. It's a browser-based wallet for Aion Network. Available at <a href="https://getaiwa.com">getaiwa.com</a></p>
<p>We incorporated a lot of user feedback from the Aion community during the public beta period. </p>
<p><img src="/images/work/aiwa.png" width=80%/></p>
<p><a name="enzyme"></a></p>
<h3>Enzyme (2019)</h3>
<p>Browser-based wallet for Polkadot Network. With the experience of building AIWA, <strong>we were able to build Enzyme much faster</strong>. Available at <a href="https://getenzyme.dev">getenzyme.dev</a>  </p>
<p><strong>I designed the UI</strong> based on standard Material Design to keep it consistent with other Google designs, as well as allow for speedier development.

<p><a name="uw"></a></p>
<h3>Universal Wallet (2019)</h3>
<p>The third and final wallet I worked on. <strong>Refined the vision</strong> of what a multi-cryptocurrency wallet should look and feel like, as well as support more complicated use cases.  </p>

<h3>Telecom Point-of-Presence Single-Step Deployment (2017)</h3>
<p>Telecom infrastructure is complicated, multilayered, and can be difficult to manage. But nowadays, legacy protocols can be encapsulated on top of IP and hardware can be virtualized.</p>
<p>For roaming customers, having a local point-of-presence (PoP) near where they are traveling is crucial for low latency internet access. <strong>I created a system to dynamically spin up an entire virtualized PoP with a single command.</strong> Because it was based on Hashicorp's <a href="http://terraform.io">Terraform</a>, it was <strong>easy to integrate with both AWS and Azure</strong>, easy to upgrade nodes, easy to create the separate subnets, and isolate the types of traffic.</p>
<p>The most important thing was that the development environment could <strong>match staging and production</strong>. It's hard enough integrating with telecom applications without having mismatched environments.</p>
<p><img src="/images/work/telecom-terraform.png" width=70%/></p>
<p><a name="kdnb"></a></p>
<h3>kdnb (Key Deploy NetBox) (2017)</h3>
<p><strong>Developed Python-based SSH key management and deployment system</strong>, integrated with <a href="https://netbox.readthedocs.io">Netbox</a> (our IPAM), to simplify tracking of developers‚Äô SSH keys. </p>
<p>Developers were assigned a Netbox profile with their SSH keys uploaded, and access privileges controlled within a custom Netbox setting.</p>
<p>When SSH keys needed to be redeployed, a <strong>single command would trigger deployment</strong> to all systems with the authorized developers automatically added to the correct servers. And multithreaded/multiprocessed execution <strong>sped up deployment by 20x</strong>, from minutes to just 20 seconds to deploy to 500 VMs.</p>

<img src="/images/work/kdnb-2.png" width=80%/></p>
<p><a name="nbssh"></a></p>
<h3>nbssh (NetBox SSH) (2017)</h3>
<p><strong>Developed a tool to speed up SSHing</strong> into servers. Rather than looking up a server in the Netbox interface or guessing the name using DNS, developers could search for a substring of the server they wanted to connect to. The matches would be displayed and the developer could then connect directly. <strong>Saved dozens of seconds</strong> every time developers needed to SSH into something. <a href="https://github.com/jonpurdy/nbssh">Github link</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/work/nbssh.png" width=80%/></p>
<p><a name="kui"></a></p>
<h3>kui - KR User Info Tool (2016)</h3>
<p>Detailed description pending.</p>
<p><a name="statsd2prtg"></a></p>
<h3>statsd2prtg (2016)</h3>
<p>In order to feed metrics from a proprietary telecom software package into our PRTG monitoring system, I needed to write a collector. That software output its stats using StatsD, so I wrote a listener that collects the data and periodically POSTed it to our PRTG HTTP API. <a href="https://github.com/jonpurdy/statsd2prtg">Github</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/work/statsd2prtg.jpg" width=80%/></p>
<p><a name="krld"></a></p>
<h3>krld (KnowRoaming Long Distance) Python Rewrite (2017)</h3>
<p>Python rewrite of older PHP-based long distance calling server to support our new telecom network infrastructure and APIs, as well as improve performance and ease of maintenance.</p>
<p><img src="/images/work/krld.png" width="80%" /></p>
<p><a name="dedicatedcloudmigration"></a></p>
<h3>Dedicated Hardware to Cloud Migration (2015)</h3>
<p>Implemented redundant, load-balanced web infrastructure. Allowed for website to be deployed to a UAT environment as well as trickling production users onto it with zero downtime.</p>
<p><a name="knowshipping"></a></p>
<h3>knowshipping (2015)</h3>
<p><strong>Developed a custom web-based shipping portal</strong> for preparing CSV files for our shipping partners, sending out confirmation emails, and allowing support agents to reference shipping information.</p>
